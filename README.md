# Getting Started

Welcome to your new project.

It contains these folders and files, following our recommended project layout:

`srv/` | your service models and code go here
`package.json` | project metadata and configuration
`readme.md` | this getting started guide


## Prerequisite

You need to create a Job Scheduling Service instance called **jobscheduler** on SAP BTP Subaccount
   or, if you have an existing instance, you need to properly edit mta.yaml file


## Next Steps

- Install dependencies: `npm i`
- Login to CF: `cf login`
- Build: `mbt build`
- Deploy: `deploy mta_archives/schedul_sample_1.0.0.mtar`
- Check if service keys exist for db and auth service: `cf service-keys SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME`
- Create service keys if necessary: `cf create-service-key SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE_KEY`
- Binding to service instances: `cds bind -2 SERVICE_INSTANCE_NAME:SERVICE_INSTANCE_KEY`
- Check if file .cdsrc-private.json has been created after service binding
- Start: `cds watch --profile hybrid`
